This project combines POV-Ray and Python to create an animation. 

First, I created a scene in POV-Ray. The scene is of a boat on the ocean. 

Next, I wrote a Python program that reads in the POV-Ray code and inserts multiple objects into a new POV-Ray file "temp". 
The objects are a sphere and torus that represent a floatie and ball. 

Using the camera in POV-Ray, the Python code slightly changes point-of-view of the scene. 
Looping through this movement hundreds of times renders pictures that represent this change.

Finally, all photos are combined to create an animation that includes the beginning scene and additional objects. 
The camera moves about the scene in a helical pattern.
